# Compage.dev
Low-Code Framework to develop Microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL API, gRPC, dRPC, WebAssembly code, Temporal.io Workflows, Temporal.io Workers, etc. with visual coding and by automatically applying best practice methods like software supply chain security measures, SBOM, etc. Auto generate code after defining requirements in UI as architecture diagram. 

### Draw the requirements for backend, generate code, customize and maintain.
> Our goal is to support both auto-generate code and import existing code. Let's see how far we can go with importing existing code support. One step at a time! 

#### Supports:
- GoLang
- Rust
- Python
- Node.js
- Deno
- WebAssembly
- Temporal.io 
- Applications/Infra API Gateway
- Data API Gateway
- Runtime env in local with everything running in browser via WebAssembly & Containerized OS / Web-Containers (similar to the concepts/designs of browsix, openvscode-server, stackblitz.com, loft vcluster, etc.) 

> support of different programming languages and frameworks will be added one by one with community contribution.
