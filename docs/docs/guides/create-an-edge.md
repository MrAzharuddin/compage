# Create an edge (a connection from src to dest)

An edge in Compage represents a connection from source microservice to destination service. Source microservice is a server here, and destination microservice is a client.

- If you want to create connection between nodes, you can drag from source node to destination node.
- You can add properties to an edge too by double-clicking on it. You may have to select the edge and then double-click on it.
- The properties for the edge are just name and port (which is by default selected). Once the name is added, the edge gets renamed to that name.
